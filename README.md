## BSc Sebastian WÃ¸hlk
This repository is meant to serve as the appendices for my bachelor's thesis.
I've tailored a pipeline to sort 16S inferred metagenome samples and their correspoding metabolites for biological relevancce through KEGG database linking.

Additionally, you will be able to find a flowchart illustrating the pipeline workflow, an example data set and a readme walking you through the pipeline, should you want to check it out.
