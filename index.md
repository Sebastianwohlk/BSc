### About
I've tailored a pipeline to sort 16S inferred metagenome samples and their correspoding metabolites for biological relevancce through KEGG database linking.
Additionally, I've carried out zOTU-compound correlations based on KEGG database links and plotted these against the amount of database links to test the hypothesis that these two entities would correlate.
